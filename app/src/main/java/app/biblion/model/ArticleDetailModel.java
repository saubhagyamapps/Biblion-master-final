Dr. Amit Thomas","description":"Essential to any study dealing with the formative period of the biblical\r\nworld is its broader eastern Mediterranean historical and cultural\r\ncontext. The final centuries of the Late Bronze Age, spanning roughly\r\n1400-1200 B.C.E., have often been characterized as an \"age of internationalism.\"\r\nBut as the thirteenth century drew to a close, this interconnected\r\nworld of the eastern Mediterranean witnessed irreversible changes and\r\ncrises that led to the collapse or gradual decline of imperial aspirations\r\nand the \"old order\" that had prevailed throughout much of the second\r\nmillennium B.C.E.\r\nPrior to this crisis, the cultures of this region formed part of a \"global\r\neconomy,\" a concept first explored by Immanuel Wallerstein (1974) in his\r\nstudy of the emergence of capitalist world domination. Although the Old\r\nWorld Late Bronze Age economic and political structures differed vastly\r\nfrom the modern capitalistic system, both are characterized by welldeveloped\r\ncommercial and political contacts coinciding with the rise of\r\nempires and regional imperialism. This interlocking system of economic,\r\npoliticat and cultural relations between center, periphery, semiperiphery,\r\nand external areas was reflected in both the textual and archaeological\r\nevidence. In addition to the exchange of objects and peoples, there was\r\ndoubtless large-scale cross-fertilization of knowledge, technology, concepts,\r\nideologies, political systems, and cultural styles and practices. The\r\nimpact both positive and negative, of these economic, political, and cultural\r\ncontacts throughout the eastern Mediterranean during the final\r\ncenturies of the Bronze Age cannot be underestimated. Due to the overwhelming\r\ninfluence this \"world economy\" had on the development of\r\nidentities, ideologies, cultures, and the shorter-term history of the region,\r\nthis chapter utilizes a \"world-systems approach\" in order to grapple with\r\nthe complex interconnected world of the eastern Mediterranean during\r\nthe Late Bronze Age and its subsequent gradual disintegration. The ensuing\r\nfragmentation resulted in the rise of new power centers and political\r\n-2l22\r\nBIBLICAL PEOPLES AND ETHNICITY\r\nsystems, the assertion of indigenous cultures, and, in some cases, the\r\nmovements of people.\r\nEgypt and Cyprus played an especially influential role in Canaan\r\nduring this period. Egypt was the major political force in Canaan during\r\nthe Late Bronze Age, so the later appearance of regionally defined material\r\ncultures in Canaan and the ethnogenesis of Israel can be understood\r\nonly within the framework of the political and economic decline of\r\nEgyptian influence in Canaan during the Twentieth Dynasty of New\r\nKingdom Egypt and its subsequent demise (see ch. 2). To the northwest\r\nof Canaan, thirteenth-century B.C.E. Cyprus was a major participant in\r\nthe international trading network, serving as the link or interface\r\nbetween the Levant and the Aegean (see table 1 for comparative chronological\r\nterms). Later twelfth-century B.C.E. developments on Cyprus,\r\ncoastal Anatolia, and in the Dodecanese were a result of the decline of\r\nthe mainland Mycenaean palace system in the western Aegean and the\r\ncollapse of the Hittite Empire. The ensuing prosperity experienced in\r\nthis region, especially on Cyprus during this period (Late Cypriot IlIA),\r\nhad a direct influence and impact on the appearance of the biblical\r\nPhilistines and their urban culture along the southern coastal plain of\r\nCanaan (see ch. 5). However, perhaps the most fascinating enigma of\r\nthis period is the cause for the collapse of the world-system that connected\r\nthe eastern Mediterranean and for the socioeconomic transformation\r\nthat marked the end of the Bronze Age. This restructuring of the secondmillennium\r\nBronze Age world created a multicultural mosaic of cultures\r\nand ideologies that resulted in the rise and development of the firstmillennium\r\nbiblical world.\r\nDATE EGYPT CANAAN GREECE CYPRUS\r\n(B.C.E.)\r\n1400\r\n18th Dynasty Late Bronze Late Helladic Late Cypriot\r\nIrA fIlA rIB\r\n1300\r\n19th Dynasty Late Bronze Late Helladic Late Cypriot\r\nIlB IlIB IIC\r\n1200\r\n20th Dynasty Iron I Late Helladic Late Cypriot\r\nmc IliA\r\n1100\r\nTable 1: Comparative Table of Chronological Terms in the Eastern\r\nMediterranean (ca. 1300-1100 B.C.E.)\r\nTHE AGE OF INTERNATIONALISM\r\nWORLD-SYSTEMS ApPROACH\r\nThe world-systems perspective is a framework for understanding\r\nlong-term social change based on an analysis of the integrated system of\r\ninterconnecting economic relations that exist between societies. It is an\r\noutgrowth of systems theory, which became a predominant tool of analysis\r\nin the social sciences during the late 1960s and 1970s. Systems theory\r\nclassifies cultural systems into various subsystems with the aim of understanding\r\nand tracing societal change over time.1 As developed by\r\nImmanuel Wallerstein (1974; 1979; 1998, 103-6), world-systems analysis\r\ncombines both systems theory and Marxist elements into a more integrated\r\napproach that is in part a statement against evolutionary-based\r\ntheories of societal and economic development. In his early writings,\r\nWallerstein argued for three basic types of world systems-world\r\neconomies, world empires, and mini-systems-three systems that in\r\nrecent years have also been adapted to precapitalist societies.2 Although\r\nWallerstein initially questioned the applicability of a world-systems\r\napproach to precapitalist societies, it has proved to be a useful heuristic\r\ntool for analyzing the archaeological record.3\r\nSeveral concepts are crucial to understanding world-systems theory.\r\nThe terms core and periphery are well known from the fields of history and\r\ngeography. In this approach, the economy of peripheral areas (periphery) is\r\nclosely connected to the exploitative policies of the economic core. Two\r\nadditional components are often included in world-systems analyses: the\r\nsemiperiphery (which serves a mediating role between core and periphery)\r\nand the external zone (or areas external to the system). The basic premise of\r\nthis approach is that the inequitable distribution of wealth is a result of\r\ncenter (or core) exploitation of periphery regions as mediated by semiperiphery\r\nareas. One of the strengths of world-systems analysis is its\r\nrecognition of marginal peoples in historical development; in contrast, most\r\ntheories dealing with long-term, large-scale societal change tend to exclude\r\nsuch groups (Chase-Dmlli and Hall 1993, esp. 851-52; T. D. Hall 2000a).4\r\nThe difficulty in applying center-periphery concepts to the archaeological\r\nrecord is that it is not always easy, in the absence of a historical context, to\r\ndistinguish among core, semiperiphery, or periphery in the material culture\r\n(see Champion 1989, 1-9).\r\nThe role of the semiperiphery is an especially relevant concept for\r\ninterpreting economic interconnections in the late second-millennium\r\neastern Mediterranean region. The semiperiphery serves as a buffer zone\r\nto protect the core from periphery pressures and often plays a key role in\r\neconomic interactions between various regions (see Chase-Dunn 1988;\r\nDietler 1989; M. J. Allen 1997,41-43). In addition, the interaction between\r\ncenter, periphery, and semiperiphery is dynamic, and roles can shift over\r\nBIBLICAL PEOPLES AND ETHNICITY\r\ntime, with semiperipheral regions becoming core areas or serving a less\r\npivotal role as a marginalized periphery. The semiperiphery, often\r\nlocated at a crossroads between core regions or core and periphery, can\r\ncombine both core and peripheral forms of organization and often fulfills\r\nthe role of \"middleman\" in their transactions. As a result, the more\r\ndynamic semiperiphery is likely to generate new institutional forms, to\r\nserve as a fertile ground for social, organizational, and technological\r\ninnovation, or to establish new centers of resource control at the first\r\nsigns of weakness on the part of the core powers (see Chase-Dunn 1988,\r\n31; M. J. Allen 1997, 42). The regions that are referred to in succeeding\r\nchapters as areas of interface fulfill the role of the semiperiphery and\r\nserve as the intermediary between core and periphery areas or between\r\nvarious centers or periphery zones.s\r\nDuring the thirteenth century B.C.E., Egypt, Hittite Hatti, Assyria,\r\nand most likely areas of mainland Greece can be defined as \"core\" areas.\r\nPeripheral regions would include portions of the Levant (excluding the\r\nmajor city-states) and the marginal zones of Egypt, Anatolia, and the\r\nAegean. Cyprus, several key cities along the Levantine and Anatolian\r\ncoasts (most notably Ugarit), and probably other regions of \"interface\"\r\nthat experienced various degrees of center control and influence (or\r\nwhat can be termed a \"contested periphery\") functioned as \"middlemen\"\r\nin the lively international trade nehvork that thrived during the\r\nthirteenth century.\r\nEMPIRES, PALACE SYSTEMS, AND CITy-STATES\r\nThe political and cultural constellation in the eastern Mediterranean\r\nregion and the Near East during the age of internationalism included the\r\nHittite, Babylonian, Assyrian, and Egyptian Empires. These centers of\r\npower reshaped the region throughout most of the second half of the\r\nsecond millennium. Mainland Greece6 and Cyprus7 also played an influential\r\nrole in international affairs. Membership in this elite \"club\" is\r\nreflected in the fourteenth- to thirteenth-century correspondence from\r\narchives and inscriptions discovered in Anatolia, Syria, and Egypt. In this\r\ndiplomatic interchange, rulers of equal status are addressed as \"brothers,\"\r\nwhile vassal subordinates are referred to as I'sons.\" The resulting\r\npolitical system in the ancient Near East during the Late Bronze Age thus\r\ncombined a double level of political rule with a hierarchical system of\r\nlarge regional units based on a higher level of \"great kings\" (or \"centers\")\r\nand a lower level of \"lesser kings\" (or \"peripheries/semiperipheries\"),\r\nwho were bound by treaties to rulers of empires (see Cline 1994).8\r\nPolitically and economically, one of the most noteworthy features of\r\nthe Late Bronze Age was the appearance of centralized administration in\r\nTHE AGE OF INTERNATIONALISM\r\nlarge palace complexes. Throughout the eastern Mediterranean region,\r\nthe palace served as the administrative center and seat of the local ruler\r\nin an urban settlement. In the case of the \"small kings,\" the palaces' control\r\nextended to the respective surrounding hinterland. The same\r\ncentralized system on a larger imperial scale was used by the great kings\r\nof the Egyptian, Hittite, and Assyrian Empires to administer their areas\r\nof influence, with the smaller urban centers serving as the hinterland to\r\nthe major centers. Economically, monopolistic production and intensive\r\ninterregional trade characterized the palace system.9 The closely interrelated\r\npolitical and economic structure of the eastern Mediterranean\r\nregion during the thirteenth century was reflected in mass-produced\r\nand standardized pottery and the exchange of prestige objects, the\r\nformer being especially observable in the homogeneous ceramic repertoire\r\nof Canaan.1O\r\nIn the Syro-Palestinian region, the double level of political rule was\r\nparticularly evident because of the numerous small, semiautonomous\r\ncity-states, each with local dynasties.ll Greater Canaan was divided\r\nbetween the two major core powers of the region following the Battle at\r\nKadesh on the Orontes River (1285 B.C.E.). Hittite authority extended\r\nover parts of northern Levant (Syria), while the Egyptians viewed southern\r\nLevant (Palestine) as part of their sphere of influence. Based on\r\nEgyptian and Hittite texts, it is evident that the administrative style of\r\nthe two major powers differed. The Egyptian vassal states had welldefined\r\nobligations, while the pharaoh had few. The goal of the\r\nEgyptians was the extraction of tribute, control over the major routes\r\ncrossing Canaan, and the prevention of rebellion. On the other hand,\r\nHittite treaties with vassal states reflected a more mutually beneficial\r\nrelationship, with clearly defined Hittite obligations to its vassal states\r\n(Knapp 1988b, 187; Klengel1992, 112).\r\nHittite diplomatic correspondence refers to a region called Ahhiyawa,\r\nwhich many scholars believe was located on mainland Greece.12 If, in fact,\r\nthis identification is correct, Mycenaean Greece during this time may have\r\nhad a great king who is referred to as a \"brother\" in Hittite texts. The\r\narchaeological and Linear B textual evidence, however, does not seem to\r\nsupport the claim of one major center that united Greece under a single\r\ncharismatic political and divine leader, and currently there is no agreement\r\nregarding the socioeconomic and political structure of Mycenaean\r\nGreece.13 Archaeological excavations at several major palace centers such\r\nas Mycenae, Argos, Midea, Tiryns, and Pylos seem to support the view of\r\nmany competing but equal centers.\r\nThe Mycenaean Bronze Age palace site at Pylos is a case in point. The\r\nresults of excavations at Pylos and systematic surveys in the surrounding\r\nregion of Messenia provide invaluable evidence regarding the evolution\r\nBIBLICAL PEOPLES AND ETHNICITY\r\nof administrative authority in Late Bronze Age Greece. Already an\r\nimportant center in the Early Mycenaean period, Pylos increased and\r\nexpanded its power during the fourteenth century, apparently at the\r\nexpense of its neighboring rivals. Much of its wealth resulted from the\r\nproduction of the perfumed oil that played a key role in Pylos' economy\r\n(Shelmerdine 1985). Survey data and the Linear B texts14 found at the site\r\nindicate that increased centralization occurred during the thirteenth century\r\nB.C.E., which is also demonstrated by additions made to the central\r\npalace (see fig. 1.1; Davis, Alcock, Bennet, Lolos, and Shelmerdine 1997;\r\nJ. L. Davis 1998; Shelmerdine 1998). Nevertheless, this increased centralization\r\nin the palace may also have represented attempts to protect the\r\ncenter and its resources during a time of greater economic and political\r\nconstraints-perhaps even foreshadowing events that resulted in the\r\ntransformation and decline of the Mycenaean palace system at the end of\r\nthe thirteenth and early twelfth centuries B.C.E. (Shelmerdine 1999; 2001).\r\nCrete and other areas in the Aegean during the fourteenth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies B.C.E. were not part of an empire, nor were they united\r\nunder one great king.15 Crete's social and economic structure can be characterized\r\nas comprising autonomous polities. Its main interest in the\r\nLevant and Egypt was apparently economic, as demonstrated by the\r\nabundant imported Aegean objects found in the east. Both the textual and\r\nthe archaeological evidence suggest that the political and economic structure\r\nof mainland Greece and its periphery (the Aegean Islands, and\r\neastern Aegean coastal regions) differed from the empire-oriented Near\r\nEast.16 Mirroring political developments on the mainland, the second half\r\nof the thirteenth century on Crete was a period of upheaval. Gradually,\r\nmany of the Late Minoan sites were abandoned or destroyed, followed\r\nby the establishment of what has been termed in the literature as \"refuge\r\nsites.\" More than a hundred settlements have been identified in defensible\r\nor remote locations; however, these sites are diverse and do not\r\nrepresent a single settlement pattern (Kanta 1980; 2001; Whitley 1991;\r\nNowicki 2000; 2001; Haggis 2001). As suggested by Anna Lucia D' Agata\r\n(2003), these newly established or reoccupied settlements may represent\r\nII colonies\" of various groups, some foreign in origin, but most a result of\r\nthe resettlement of local populations.17\r\nWith the dissolution of the great power centers that commenced in\r\nthe thirteenth century B.C.E., the concentration of political and economic\r\npower in the palaces transformed their physical collapse into a general\r\ndisaster for several of the larger regional powers. On the other hand, the\r\ndecline or collapse of these \"superpowers\" liberated many of those areas\r\nthat had been under their control and, presumably, exploitation. The\r\nbreakdown of international lines of communication behveen the empires\r\nwas replaced by more local contacts, which resulted in the fragmentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEssential to any study dealing with the formative period of the biblical\r\nworld is its broader eastern Mediterranean historical and cultural\r\ncontext. The final centuries of the Late Bronze Age, spanning roughly\r\n1400-1200 B.C.E., have often been characterized as an \"age of internationalism.\"\r\nBut as the thirteenth century drew to a close, this interconnected\r\nworld of the eastern Mediterranean witnessed irreversible changes and\r\ncrises that led to the collapse or gradual decline of imperial aspirations\r\nand the \"old order\" that had prevailed throughout much of the second\r\nmillennium B.C.E.\r\nPrior to this crisis, the cultures of this region formed part of a \"global\r\neconomy,\" a concept first explored by Immanuel Wallerstein (1974) in his\r\nstudy of the emergence of capitalist world domination.

         * description : Essential to any study dealing with the formative period of the biblical
         world is its broader eastern Mediterranean historical and cultural
         context. The final centuries of the Late Bronze Age, spanning roughly
         1400-1200 B.C.E., have often been characterized as an "age of internationalism."
         But as the thirteenth century drew to a close, this interconnected
         world of the eastern Mediterranean witnessed irreversible changes and
         crises that led to the collapse or gradual decline of imperial aspirations
         and the "old order" that had prevailed throughout much of the second
         millennium B.C.E.
         Prior to this crisis, the cultures of this region formed part of a "global
         economy," a concept first explored by Immanuel Wallerstein (1974) in his
         study of the emergence of capitalist world domination. Although the Old
         World Late Bronze Age economic and political structures differed vastly
         from the modern capitalistic system, both are characterized by welldeveloped
         commercial and political contacts coinciding with the rise of
         empires and regional imperialism. This interlocking system of economic,
         politicat and cultural relations between center, periphery, semiperiphery,
         and external areas was reflected in both the textual and archaeological
         evidence. In addition to the exchange of objects and peoples, there was
         doubtless large-scale cross-fertilization of knowledge, technology, concepts,
         ideologies, political systems, and cultural styles and practices. The
         impact both positive and negative, of these economic, political, and cultural
         contacts throughout the eastern Mediterranean during the final
         centuries of the Bronze Age cannot be underestimated. Due to the overwhelming
         influence this "world economy" had on the development of
         identities, ideologies, cultures, and the shorter-term history of the region,
         this chapter utilizes a "world-systems approach" in order to grapple with
         the complex interconnected world of the eastern Mediterranean during
         the Late Bronze Age and its subsequent gradual disintegration. The ensuing

         movements of people.
         Egypt and Cyprus played an especially influential role in Canaan
         during this period. Egypt was the major political force in Canaan during
         the Late Bronze Age, so the later appearance of regionally defined material
         cultures in Canaan and the ethnogenesis of Israel can be understood
         only within the framework of the political and economic decline of
         Egyptian influence in Canaan during the Twentieth Dynasty of New
         Kingdom Egypt and its subsequent demise (see ch. 2). To the northwest
         of Canaan, thirteenth-century B.C.E. Cyprus was a major participant in
         the international trading network, serving as the link or interface
         between the Levant and the Aegean (see table 1 for comparative chronological
         terms). Later twelfth-century B.C.E. developments on Cyprus,
         coastal Anatolia, and in the Dodecanese were a result of the decline of
         the mainland Mycenaean palace system in the western Aegean and the
         collapse of the Hittite Empire. The ensuing prosperity experienced in
         this region, especially on Cyprus during this period (Late Cypriot IlIA),
         had a direct influence and impact on the appearance of the biblical
         Philistines and their urban culture along the southern coastal plain of
         Canaan (see ch. 5). However, perhaps the most fascinating enigma of
         this period is the cause for the collapse of the world-system that connected
         the eastern Mediterranean and for the socioeconomic transformation
         that marked the end of the Bronze Age. This restructuring of the secondmillennium
         Bronze Age world created a multicultural mosaic of cultures
         and ideologies that resulted in the rise and development of the firstmillennium
         biblical world.

         THE AGE OF INTERNATIONALISM
         WORLD-SYSTEMS ApPROACH
         The world-systems perspective is a framework for understanding
         long-term social change based on an analysis of the integrated system of
         interconnecting economic relations that exist between societies. It is an
         outgrowth of systems theory, which became a predominant tool of analysis
         in the social sciences during the late 1960s and 1970s. Systems theory
         classifies cultural systems into various subsystems with the aim of understanding
         and tracing societal change over time.1 As developed by
         Immanuel Wallerstein (1974; 1979; 1998, 103-6), world-systems analysis
         combines both systems theory and Marxist elements into a more integrated
         approach that is in part a statement against evolutionary-based
         theories of societal and economic development. In his early writings,
         Wallerstein argued for three basic types of world systems-world
         economies, world empires, and mini-systems-three systems that in
         recent years have also been adapted to precapitalist societies.2 Although
         Wallerstein initially questioned the applicability of a world-systems
         approach to precapitalist societies, it has proved to be a useful heuristic
         tool for analyzing the archaeological record.3
         Several concepts are crucial to understanding world-systems theory.
         The terms core and periphery are well known from the fields of history and
         geography. In this approach, the economy of peripheral areas (periphery) is
         closely connected to the exploitative policies of the economic core. Two
         additional components are often included in world-systems analyses: the
         semiperiphery (which serves a mediating role between core and periphery)
         and the external zone (or areas external to the system). The basic premise of
         this approach is that the inequitable distribution of wealth is a result of
         center (or core) exploitation of periphery regions as mediated by semiperiphery
         areas. One of the strengths of world-systems analysis is its
         recognition of marginal peoples in historical development; in contrast, most
         theories dealing with long-term, large-scale societal change tend to exclude
         such groups (Chase-Dmlli and Hall 1993, esp. 851-52; T. D. Hall 2000a).4
         The difficulty in applying center-periphery concepts to the archaeological
         record is that it is not always easy, in the absence of a historical context, to
         distinguish among core, semiperiphery, or periphery in the material culture
         (see Champion 1989, 1-9).
         The role of the semiperiphery is an especially relevant concept for
         interpreting economic interconnections in the late second-millennium
         eastern Mediterranean region. The semiperiphery serves as a buffer zone
         to protect the core from periphery pressures and often plays a key role in
         economic interactions between various regions (see Chase-Dunn 1988;
         Dietler 1989; M. J. Allen 1997,41-43). In addition, the interaction between
         center, periphery, and semiperiphery is dynamic, and roles can shift over
         BIBLICAL PEOPLES AND ETHNICITY
         time, with semiperipheral regions becoming core areas or serving a less
         pivotal role as a marginalized periphery. The semiperiphery, often
         located at a crossroads between core regions or core and periphery, can
         combine both core and peripheral forms of organization and often fulfills
         the role of "middleman" in their transactions. As a result, the more
         dynamic semiperiphery is likely to generate new institutional forms, to
         serve as a fertile ground for social, organizational, and technological
         innovation, or to establish new centers of resource control at the first
         signs of weakness on the part of the core powers (see Chase-Dunn 1988,
         31; M. J. Allen 1997, 42). The regions that are referred to in succeeding
         chapters as areas of interface fulfill the role of the semiperiphery and
         serve as the intermediary between core and periphery areas or between
         various centers or periphery zones.s
         During the thirteenth century B.C.E., Egypt, Hittite Hatti, Assyria,
         and most likely areas of mainland Greece can be defined as "core" areas.
         Peripheral regions would include portions of the Levant (excluding the
         major city-states) and the marginal zones of Egypt, Anatolia, and the
         Aegean. Cyprus, several key cities along the Levantine and Anatolian
         coasts (most notably Ugarit), and probably other regions of "interface"
         that experienced various degrees of center control and influence (or
         what can be termed a "contested periphery") functioned as "middlemen"
         in the lively international trade nehvork that thrived during the
         thirteenth century.
         EMPIRES, PALACE SYSTEMS, AND CITy-STATES
         The political and cultural constellation in the eastern Mediterranean
         region and the Near East during the age of internationalism included the
         Hittite, Babylonian, Assyrian, and Egyptian Empires. These centers of
         power reshaped the region throughout most of the second half of the
         second millennium. Mainland Greece6 and Cyprus7 also played an influential
         role in international affairs. Membership in this elite "club" is
         reflected in the fourteenth- to thirteenth-century correspondence from
         archives and inscriptions discovered in Anatolia, Syria, and Egypt. In this
         diplomatic interchange, rulers of equal status are addressed as "brothers,"
         while vassal subordinates are referred to as I'sons." The resulting
         political system in the ancient Near East during the Late Bronze Age thus
         combined a double level of political rule with a hierarchical system of
         large regional units based on a higher level of "great kings" (or "centers")
         and a lower level of "lesser kings" (or "peripheries/semiperipheries"),
         who were bound by treaties to rulers of empires (see Cline 1994).8
         Politically and economically, one of the most noteworthy features of
         the Late Bronze Age was the appearance of centralized administration in
         THE AGE OF INTERNATIONALISM
         large palace complexes. Throughout the eastern Mediterranean region,
         the palace served as the administrative center and seat of the local ruler
         in an urban settlement. In the case of the "small kings," the palaces' control
         extended to the respective surrounding hinterland. The same
         centralized system on a larger imperial scale was used by the great kings
         of the Egyptian, Hittite, and Assyrian Empires to administer their areas
         of influence, with the smaller urban centers serving as the hinterland to
         the major centers. Economically, monopolistic production and intensive
         interregional trade characterized the palace system.9 The closely interrelated
         political and economic structure of the eastern Mediterranean
         region during the thirteenth century was reflected in mass-produced
         and standardized pottery and the exchange of prestige objects, the
         former being especially observable in the homogeneous ceramic repertoire
         of Canaan.1O
         In the Syro-Palestinian region, the double level of political rule was
         particularly evident because of the numerous small, semiautonomous
         city-states, each with local dynasties.ll Greater Canaan was divided
         between the two major core powers of the region following the Battle at
         Kadesh on the Orontes River (1285 B.C.E.). Hittite authority extended
         over parts of northern Levant (Syria), while the Egyptians viewed southern
         Levant (Palestine) as part of their sphere of influence. Based on
         Egyptian and Hittite texts, it is evident that the administrative style of
         the two major powers differed. The Egyptian vassal states had welldefined
         obligations, while the pharaoh had few. The goal of the
         Egyptians was the extraction of tribute, control over the major routes
         crossing Canaan, and the prevention of rebellion. On the other hand,
         Hittite treaties with vassal states reflected a more mutually beneficial
         relationship, with clearly defined Hittite obligations to its vassal states
         (Knapp 1988b, 187; Klengel1992, 112).
         Hittite diplomatic correspondence refers to a region called Ahhiyawa,
         which many scholars believe was located on mainland Greece.12 If, in fact,
         this identification is correct, Mycenaean Greece during this time may have
         had a great king who is referred to as a "brother" in Hittite texts. The
         archaeological and Linear B textual evidence, however, does not seem to
         support the claim of one major center that united Greece under a single
         charismatic political and divine leader, and currently there is no agreement
         regarding the socioeconomic and political structure of Mycenaean
         Greece.13 Archaeological excavations at several major palace centers such
         as Mycenae, Argos, Midea, Tiryns, and Pylos seem to support the view of
         many competing but equal centers.
         The Mycenaean Bronze Age palace site at Pylos is a case in point. The
         results of excavations at Pylos and systematic surveys in the surrounding
         region of Messenia provide invaluable evidence regarding the evolution
         BIBLICAL PEOPLES AND ETHNICITY
         of administrative authority in Late Bronze Age Greece. Already an
         important center in the Early Mycenaean period, Pylos increased and
         expanded its power during the fourteenth century, apparently at the
         expense of its neighboring rivals. Much of its wealth resulted from the
         production of the perfumed oil that played a key role in Pylos' economy
         (Shelmerdine 1985). Survey data and the Linear B texts14 found at the site
         indicate that increased centralization occurred during the thirteenth century
         B.C.E., which is also demonstrated by additions made to the central
         palace (see fig. 1.1; Davis, Alcock, Bennet, Lolos, and Shelmerdine 1997;
         J. L. Davis 1998; Shelmerdine 1998). Nevertheless, this increased centralization
         in the palace may also have represented attempts to protect the
         center and its resources during a time of greater economic and political
         constraints-perhaps even foreshadowing events that resulted in the
         transformation and decline of the Mycenaean palace system at the end of
         the thirteenth and early twelfth centuries B.C.E. (Shelmerdine 1999; 2001).
         Crete and other areas in the Aegean during the fourteenth and thirteenth
         centuries B.C.E. were not part of an empire, nor were they united
         under one great king.15 Crete's social and economic structure can be characterized
         as comprising autonomous polities. Its main interest in the
         Levant and Egypt was apparently economic, as demonstrated by the
         abundant imported Aegean objects found in the east. Both the textual and
         the archaeological evidence suggest that the political and economic structure
         of mainland Greece and its periphery (the Aegean Islands, and
         eastern Aegean coastal regions) differed from the empire-oriented Near
         East.16 Mirroring political developments on the mainland, the second half
         of the thirteenth century on Crete was a period of upheaval. Gradually,
         many of the Late Minoan sites were abandoned or destroyed, followed
         by the establishment of what has been termed in the literature as "refuge
         sites." More than a hundred settlements have been identified in defensible
         or remote locations; however, these sites are diverse and do not
         represent a single settlement pattern (Kanta 1980; 2001; Whitley 1991;
         Nowicki 2000; 2001; Haggis 2001). As suggested by Anna Lucia D' Agata
         (2003), these newly established or reoccupied settlements may represent
         II colonies" of various groups, some foreign in origin, but most a result of
         the resettlement of local populations.17
         With the dissolution of the great power centers that commenced in
         the thirteenth century B.C.E., the concentration of political and economic
         power in the palaces transformed their physical collapse into a general
         disaster for several of the larger regional powers. On the other hand, the
         decline or collapse of these "superpowers" liberated many of those areas
         that had been under their control and, presumably, exploitation. The
         breakdown of international lines of communication behveen the empires
         was replaced by more local contacts, which resulted in the fragmentation.






         Essential to any study dealing with the formative period of the biblical
         world is its broader eastern Mediterranean historical and cultural
         context. The final centuries of the Late Bronze Age, spanning roughly
         1400-1200 B.C.E., have often been characterized as an "age of internationalism."
         But as the thirteenth century drew to a close, this interconnected
         world of the eastern Mediterranean witnessed irreversible changes and
         crises that led to the collapse or gradual decline of imperial aspirations
         and the "old order" that had prevailed throughout much of the second
         millennium B.C.E.
         Prior to this crisis, the cultures of this region formed part of a "global
         economy," a concept first explored by Immanuel Wallerstein (1974) in his
         study of the emergence of capitalist world domination. Although the Old
         World Late Bronze Age economic and political structures differed vastly
         from the modern capitalistic system, both are characterized by welldeveloped
         commercial and political contacts coinciding with the rise of
         empires and regional imperialism. This interlocking system of economic,
         politicat and cultural relations between center, periphery, semiperiphery,
         and external areas was reflected in both the textual and archaeological
         evidence. In addition to the exchange of objects and peoples, there was
         doubtless large-scale cross-fertilization of knowledge, technology, concepts,
         ideologies, political systems, and cultural styles and practices. The
         impact both positive and negative, of these economic, political, and cultural
         contacts throughout the eastern Mediterranean during the final
         centuries of the Bronze Age cannot be underestimated. Due to the overwhelming
         influence this "world economy" had on the development of
         identities, ideologies, cultures, and the shorter-term history of the region,
         this chapter utilizes a "world-systems approach" in order to grapple with
         the complex interconnected world of the eastern Mediterranean during
         the Late Bronze Age and its subsequent gradual disintegration. The ensuing
         fragmentation resulted in the rise of new power centers and political

         systems, the assertion of indigenous cultures, and, in some cases, the
         movements of people.
         Egypt and Cyprus played an especially influential role in Canaan
         during this period. Egypt was the major political force in Canaan during
         the Late Bronze Age, so the later appearance of regionally defined material
         cultures in Canaan and the ethnogenesis of Israel can be understood
         only within the framework of the political and economic decline of
         Egyptian influence in Canaan during the Twentieth Dynasty of New
         Kingdom Egypt and its subsequent demise (see ch. 2). To the northwest
         of Canaan, thirteenth-century B.C.E. Cyprus was a major participant in
         the international trading network, serving as the link or interface
         between the Levant and the Aegean (see table 1 for comparative chronological
         terms). Later twelfth-century B.C.E. developments on Cyprus,
         coastal Anatolia, and in the Dodecanese were a result of the decline of
         the mainland Mycenaean palace system in the western Aegean and the
         collapse of the Hittite Empire. The ensuing prosperity experienced in
         this region, especially on Cyprus during this period (Late Cypriot IlIA),
         had a direct influence and impact on the appearance of the biblical
         Philistines and their urban culture along the southern coastal plain of
         Canaan (see ch. 5). However, perhaps the most fascinating enigma of
         this period is the cause for the collapse of the world-system that connected
         the eastern Mediterranean and for the socioeconomic transformation
         that marked the end of the Bronze Age. This restructuring of the secondmillennium
         Bronze Age world created a multicultural mosaic of cultures
         and ideologies that resulted in the rise and development of the firstmillennium
         biblical world.

         THE AGE OF INTERNATIONALISM
         WORLD-SYSTEMS ApPROACH
         The world-systems perspective is a framework for understanding
         long-term social change based on an analysis of the integrated system of
         interconnecting economic relations that exist between societies. It is an
         outgrowth of systems theory, which became a predominant tool of analysis
         in the social sciences during the late 1960s and 1970s. Systems theory
         classifies cultural systems into various subsystems with the aim of understanding
         and tracing societal change over time.1 As developed by
         Immanuel Wallerstein (1974; 1979; 1998, 103-6), world-systems analysis
         combines both systems theory and Marxist elements into a more integrated
         approach that is in part a statement against evolutionary-based
         theories of societal and economic development. In his early writings,
         Wallerstein argued for three basic types of world systems-world
         economies, world empires, and mini-systems-three systems that in
         recent years have also been adapted to precapitalist societies.2 Although
         Wallerstein initially questioned the applicability of a world-systems
         approach to precapitalist societies, it has proved to be a useful heuristic
         tool for analyzing the archaeological record.3
         Several concepts are crucial to understanding world-systems theory.
         The terms core and periphery are well known from the fields of history and
         geography. In this approach, the economy of peripheral areas (periphery) is
         closely connected to the exploitative policies of the economic core. Two
         additional components are often included in world-systems analyses: the
         semiperiphery (which serves a mediating role between core and periphery)
         and the external zone (or areas external to the system). The basic premise of
         this approach is that the inequitable distribution of wealth is a result of
         center (or core) exploitation of periphery regions as mediated by semiperiphery
         areas. One of the strengths of world-systems analysis is its
         recognition of marginal peoples in historical development; in contrast, most
         theories dealing with long-term, large-scale societal change tend to exclude
         such groups (Chase-Dmlli and Hall 1993, esp. 851-52; T. D. Hall 2000a).4
         The difficulty in applying center-periphery concepts to the archaeological
         record is that it is not always easy, in the absence of a historical context, to
         distinguish among core, semiperiphery, or periphery in the material culture
         (see Champion 1989, 1-9).
         The role of the semiperiphery is an especially relevant concept for
         interpreting economic interconnections in the late second-millennium
         eastern Mediterranean region. The semiperiphery serves as a buffer zone
         to protect the core from periphery pressures and often plays a key role in
         economic interactions between various regions (see Chase-Dunn 1988;
         Dietler 1989; M. J. Allen 1997,41-43). In addition, the interaction between
         center, periphery, and semiperiphery is dynamic, and roles can shift over
         BIBLICAL PEOPLES AND ETHNICITY
         time, with semiperipheral regions becoming core areas or serving a less
         pivotal role as a marginalized periphery. The semiperiphery, often
         located at a crossroads between core regions or core and periphery, can
         combine both core and peripheral forms of organization and often fulfills
         the role of "middleman" in their transactions. As a result, the more
         dynamic semiperiphery is likely to generate new institutional forms, to
         serve as a fertile ground for social, organizational, and technological
         innovation, or to establish new centers of resource control at the first
         signs of weakness on the part of the core powers (see Chase-Dunn 1988,
         31; M. J. Allen 1997, 42). The regions that are referred to in succeeding
         chapters as areas of interface fulfill the role of the semiperiphery and
         serve as the intermediary between core and periphery areas or between
         various centers or periphery zones.s
         During the thirteenth century B.C.E., Egypt, Hittite Hatti, Assyria,
         and most likely areas of mainland Greece can be defined as "core" areas.
         Peripheral regions would include portions of the Levant (excluding the
         major city-states) and the marginal zones of Egypt, Anatolia, and the
         Aegean. Cyprus, several key cities along the Levantine and Anatolian
         coasts (most notably Ugarit), and probably other regions of "interface"
         that experienced various degrees of center control and influence (or
         what can be termed a "contested periphery") functioned as "middlemen"
         in the lively international trade nehvork that thrived during the
         thirteenth century.
         EMPIRES, PALACE SYSTEMS, AND CITy-STATES
         The political and cultural constellation in the eastern Mediterranean
         region and the Near East during the age of internationalism included the
         Hittite, Babylonian, Assyrian, and Egyptian Empires. These centers of
         power reshaped the region throughout most of the second half of the
         second millennium. Mainland Greece6 and Cyprus7 also played an influential
         role in international affairs. Membership in this elite "club" is
         reflected in the fourteenth- to thirteenth-century correspondence from
         archives and inscriptions discovered in Anatolia, Syria, and Egypt. In this
         diplomatic interchange, rulers of equal status are addressed as "brothers,"
         while vassal subordinates are referred to as I'sons." The resulting
         political system in the ancient Near East during the Late Bronze Age thus
         combined a double level of political rule with a hierarchical system of
         large regional units based on a higher level of "great kings" (or "centers")
         and a lower level of "lesser kings" (or "peripheries/semiperipheries"),
         who were bound by treaties to rulers of empires (see Cline 1994).8
         Politically and economically, one of the most noteworthy features of
         the Late Bronze Age was the appearance of centralized administration in
         THE AGE OF INTERNATIONALISM
         large palace complexes. Throughout the eastern Mediterranean region,
         the palace served as the administrative center and seat of the local ruler
         in an urban settlement. In the case of the "small kings," the palaces' control
         extended to the respective surrounding hinterland. The same
         centralized system on a larger imperial scale was used by the great kings
         of the Egyptian, Hittite, and Assyrian Empires to administer their areas
         of influence, with the smaller urban centers serving as the hinterland to
         the major centers. Economically, monopolistic production and intensive
         interregional trade characterized the palace system.9 The closely interrelated
         political and economic structure of the eastern Mediterranean
         region during the thirteenth century was reflected in mass-produced
         and standardized pottery and the exchange of prestige objects, the
         former being especially observable in the homogeneous ceramic repertoire
         of Canaan.1O
         In the Syro-Palestinian region, the double level of political rule was
         particularly evident because of the numerous small, semiautonomous
         city-states, each with local dynasties.ll Greater Canaan was divided
         between the two major core powers of the region following the Battle at
         Kadesh on the Orontes River (1285 B.C.E.). Hittite authority extended
         over parts of northern Levant (Syria), while the Egyptians viewed southern
         Levant (Palestine) as part of their sphere of influence. Based on
         Egyptian and Hittite texts, it is evident that the administrative style of
         the two major powers differed. The Egyptian vassal states had welldefined
         obligations, while the pharaoh had few. The goal of the
         Egyptians was the extraction of tribute, control over the major routes
         crossing Canaan, and the prevention of rebellion. On the other hand,
         Hittite treaties with vassal states reflected a more mutually beneficial
         relationship, with clearly defined Hittite obligations to its vassal states
         (Knapp 1988b, 187; Klengel1992, 112).
         Hittite diplomatic correspondence refers to a region called Ahhiyawa,
         which many scholars believe was located on mainland Greece.12 If, in fact,
         this identification is correct, Mycenaean Greece during this time may have
         had a great king who is referred to as a "brother" in Hittite texts. The
         archaeological and Linear B textual evidence, however, does not seem to
         support the claim of one major center that united Greece under a single
         charismatic political and divine leader, and currently there is no agreement
         regarding the socioeconomic and political structure of Mycenaean
         Greece.13 Archaeological excavations at several major palace centers such
         as Mycenae, Argos, Midea, Tiryns, and Pylos seem to support the view of
         many competing but equal centers.
         The Mycenaean Bronze Age palace site at Pylos is a case in point. The
         results of excavations at Pylos and systematic surveys in the surrounding
         region of Messenia provide invaluable evidence regarding the evolution
         BIBLICAL PEOPLES AND ETHNICITY
         of administrative authority in Late Bronze Age Greece. Already an
         important center in the Early Mycenaean period, Pylos increased and
         expanded its power during the fourteenth century, apparently at the
         expense of its neighboring rivals. Much of its wealth resulted from the
         production of the perfumed oil that played a key role in Pylos' economy
         (Shelmerdine 1985). Survey data and the Linear B texts14 found at the site
         indicate that increased centralization occurred during the thirteenth century
         B.C.E., which is also demonstrated by additions made to the central
         palace (see fig. 1.1; Davis, Alcock, Bennet, Lolos, and Shelmerdine 1997;
         J. L. Davis 1998; Shelmerdine 1998). Nevertheless, this increased centralization
         in the palace may also have represented attempts to protect the
         center and its resources during a time of greater economic and political
         constraints-perhaps even foreshadowing events that resulted in the
         transformation and decline of the Mycenaean palace system at the end of
         the thirteenth and early twelfth centuries B.C.E. (Shelmerdine 1999; 2001).
         Crete and other areas in the Aegean during the fourteenth and thirteenth
         centuries B.C.E. were not part of an empire, nor were they united
         under one great king.15 Crete's social and economic structure can be characterized
         as comprising autonomous polities. Its main interest in the
         Levant and Egypt was apparently economic, as demonstrated by the
         abundant imported Aegean objects found in the east. Both the textual and
         the archaeological evidence suggest that the political and economic structure
         of mainland Greece and its periphery (the Aegean Islands, and
         eastern Aegean coastal regions) differed from the empire-oriented Near
         East.16 Mirroring political developments on the mainland, the second half
         of the thirteenth century on Crete was a period of upheaval. Gradually,
         many of the Late Minoan sites were abandoned or destroyed, followed
         by the establishment of what has been termed in the literature as "refuge
         sites." More than a hundred settlements have been identified in defensible
         or remote locations; however, these sites are diverse and do not
         represent a single settlement pattern (Kanta 1980; 2001; Whitley 1991;
         Nowicki 2000; 2001; Haggis 2001). As suggested by Anna Lucia D' Agata
         (2003), these newly established or reoccupied settlements may represent
         II colonies" of various groups, some foreign in origin, but most a result of
         the resettlement of local populations.17
         With the dissolution of the great power centers that commenced in
         the thirteenth century B.C.E., the concentration of political and economic
         power in the palaces transformed their physical collapse into a general
         disaster for several of the larger regional powers. On the other hand, the
         decline or collapse of these "superpowers" liberated many of those areas
         that had been under their control and, presumably, exploitation. The
         breakdown of international lines of communication behveen the empires
         was replaced by more local contacts, which resulted in the fragmentation
